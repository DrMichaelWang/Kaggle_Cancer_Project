# Kaggle_Cancer_Project
Kaggle competition project "Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment" where machine learning is used to classify genetic mutations for cancer treatment. The conventional way of doing such task by means of manual classification requires tremendous time, efforts, and domain expertise. The natural language processing (NLP) techniques were utilized to develop pipeline.  Tremendous efforts in feature engineering was made, and a XGBoost-based ensembling classification model was constructed. A remarkable Top 10% ranking has been achieved on Kaggle leaderboard and I keep working to further improve the performance of the model.
